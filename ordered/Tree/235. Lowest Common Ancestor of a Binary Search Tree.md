Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]


 

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.


从顶到下，若当前值等于p、q任意一个，则return； 若大于最大值，则往左走；小于最小值，往右走；
否则，p、q处于左右两个子树上 当前结点即为最小祖先

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if p.val < q.val:
            p, q = q, p
        while root:
            if root.val == p.val:
                return root
            if root.val == q.val:
                return root
            if root.val > p.val:
                root = root.left
            elif root.val < q.val:
                root = root.right
            else:
                return root
        
```

简化：
```
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        while root:
            if root.val > max(p.val, q.val):
                root = root.left
            elif root.val <min(p.val, q.val):
                root = root.right
            else:
                return root
```

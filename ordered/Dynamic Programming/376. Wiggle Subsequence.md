A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Example 1:

Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
Example 2:

Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
Example 3:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n <2:
            return n
        up, down = [1] *n, [1] *n
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    up[i] = max(up[i], down[j]+1)
                elif nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    down[i] = max(down[i], up[j]+1)
   
        return max(down[-1], up[-1])
```

For every position in the array, there are only three possible statuses for it.

up position, it means nums[i] > nums[i-1]
down position, it means nums[i] < nums[i-1]
equals to position, nums[i] == nums[i-1]
So we can use two arrays up[] and down[] to record the max wiggle sequence length so far at index i.
If nums[i] > nums[i-1], that means it wiggles up. the element before it must be a down position. so up[i] = down[i-1] + 1; down[i] keeps the same with before.
If nums[i] < nums[i-1], that means it wiggles down. the element before it must be a up position. so down[i] = up[i-1] + 1; up[i] keeps the same with before.
If nums[i] == nums[i-1], that means it will not change anything becasue it didn't wiggle at all. so both down[i] and up[i] keep the same.

In fact, we can reduce the space complexity to O(1), but current way is more easy to understanding.

1. 定义状态： up[i]: i及之前的元素序列中最后为up最长的序列;  down[i]: i及之前的元素序列中最后为down最长的序列，
2. 状态转移
3. 初始状态 up[0] = down[0] =1

            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                up[i] = down[i-1] +1
                down[i] = down[i-1]

                up[i] = up[i-1]
            else:
                up[i], down[i] = up[i-1], down[i-1]
        return max(up[-1], down[-1])
```

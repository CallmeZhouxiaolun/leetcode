Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:

Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

由于加入了冷冻期，我们将状态分为三种: s0: 可进行购买状态最大收益 s1: 已购买状态最大收益 s2：卖出，冷冻期时最大收益
s0 可由 s0、s2转化 s1可由s0、s1转化，s2可由s1转换
```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) <=1:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        s0 = [0] *n
        s1 = [0] *n
        s2 = [0] *n
        s0[0], s1[0], s2[0] = 0, -prices[0], -sys.maxsize
        for i in range(1,n):
            s0[i] = max(s0[i-1], s2[i-1])
            s1[i] = max(s0[i-1] -prices[i], s1[i-1])
            s2[i] = s1[i-1] + prices[i]
        return max(s0[-1], s2[-1])
                
```

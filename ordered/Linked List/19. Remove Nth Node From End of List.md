Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?


还是快慢指针,先让快指针走n步
这里注意 当n大于list长度时,删除第一个结点
```
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and n:
            fast = fast.next
            n -=1
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
            
```

可以加上头结点
```
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        fast, slow = dummy, dummy
        while fast and n:
            fast = fast.next
            n -=1
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next
```

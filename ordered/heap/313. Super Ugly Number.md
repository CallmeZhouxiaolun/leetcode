Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k.

Example:

Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32 
Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 
             super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19] of size 4.
Note:

1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

        ugly =[1]
        index =[0] * len(primes)
        while n>1:
            tmp =  [ugly[index[i]] * num for i, num in enumerate(primes)]
            umin = min(tmp)
            for i, num in enumerate(tmp):
                if umin == num:
                    index[i] +=1
            ugly.append(umin)
            n-=1
        return ugly[-1]

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 3 * 104
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums?
Can you solve the problem using only constant, O(1) extra space?
Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than O(n2)?


最简单的就是使用set来处理

class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        set<int> st;
        for(int num: nums){
            if(st.find(num) != st.end())
                return num;
            st.insert(num);
        }
        return 0;
    }
};

也可以排序来处理，这里就不写了

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

这里使用的是普通方法,...没想到dp解法
```
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True
        if not t:
            return False
        m, n ,i ,j= len(s), len(t), 0,0 
        while i<m and j < n:
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i+=1
            j+=1
        return i==m
```

高效率

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(s)):
            try:
                index = t.index(s[i])
            except ValueError:
                return False
            t = t[index+1:]
        return True
```

On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Example 1:
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
Example 2:
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
Note:
cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].


设置动态规划三部曲:  
1. 定义状态: dp[n] : 以n阶台阶为最后一个台阶的最小代价
2. 状态转移方程: dp[i] = min(dp[i-2], dp[i-1]) + cost[i]
3. 初始状态: dp[0], dp[1] = cost[0], cost[1]


注意: 最后两个台阶都可结束,因此我们去最小值
```
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if not cost:
            return 0
        n = len(cost)
        if len(cost) <= 2:
            return min(cost)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0], dp[1] = cost[0], cost[1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]
        return min(dp[-1], dp[-2])
```

优化
```
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        c1, c2 = 0, 0
        for num in cost:
            c1, c2 = c2, min(c1,c2) +num
        return min(c1, c2)
```

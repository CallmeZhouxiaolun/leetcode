We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000


这里学到两个模块,首先是heapq模型即 堆  
其中heapq中为最小堆,而本题是最大堆,我们需要进行转换,我们发现以当前元素的相反数存入可以使数据有相反排序  
从而实现最大堆的思想
```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        if not stones:
            return 0
        stones = [-i for i in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        while len(stones) > 1 and stones[0] !=0:
            heapq.heappush(stones, heapq.heappop(stones)- heapq.heappop(stones))
        return -stones[0]
        
```

还有bisect模块, 其可以在有序列表中进行二叉搜索,找到欲插入元素插入索引或者直接将元素插入到有序列表使其保持有序  
```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones.sort()
        while len(stones) >1:
            bisect.insort(stones, stones.pop() - stones.pop())
        return stones[0]     
```

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000



这个题要理解...  ,看了很多解答和证明,下面这句话最容易理解
Why is it optimal to choose 1 when you get even number? I think it can be proved as below.  
The key is whoever gets 1 looses. So if you got an even number and keep choosing 1 then your opponent will always get odd number  
(no matter what her/his choice of number is) and eventually that odd number will become 1.   
So for the player who gets even number, choosing 1 is bound to winning and thus optimal (might not be the fastest way to win though).

```
class Solution:
    def divisorGame(self, N: int) -> bool:
        return N %2==0
```


这里用动规三部曲:
1. 定义状态: dp[n] : 当N=n时,Alice获胜
2. 状态转移方程: 找到 1 <x <n and n %x==0, 对于该x 给与对手的数字是n-x; 若存在dp[n-x] ==False,即对手输,Alice赢
3. 定义初始状态: dp[1] =False
```
class Solution:
    def divisorGame(self, N: int) -> bool:
        dp = [0]*(N+1)
        for i in range(2, N+1):
            for j in range(1, i//2+1):
                if i %j ==0 and not dp[i-j]:
                    dp[i] = 1
                    break
        return dp[-1]
        
```

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')


1. 定义状态: dp[i][j] : word1的前i个字符和word2的前j个字符匹配的最小个数
2. 状态转移：
    * 先进行判断 word1[i] == word2[j] True: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]  
    * 为否：dp[i][j]可以由dp[i-1][j-1]+1 即word2[i],word2[j]替换而来；dp[i][j-1]+1 即将word2的第j个字符删除,或者word1[i-1]添加一个元素；dp[i-1][j]+1 和前一个类似
3. 初始化
```
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[0][i] = i
        for i in range(1,m+1):
            for j in range(1,n+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]) +1
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
             
动态规划三部曲:
1. 定义状态: dp[n][j] : 前n套房子,同时最后一套房子颜色为j时候的最小cost j取值0,1,2
2. 状态转移方程: 例: dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i][0]
3. 初始化: dp[0][0] = costs[0][0]  dp[0][1] = costs[0][1]  dp[0][2] = costs[0][2]

```
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs:
            return 0
        n = len(costs)
        if len(costs) == 1:
            return min(costs[0])
        dp = [[0,0,0] for _ in range(n)]
        dp[0] = costs[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i][0]
            dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i][1]
            dp[i][2] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + costs[i][2]
        return min(dp[-1])
        
```

优化
```
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not costs or not costs[0]:
            return 0
        for i in range(1, len(costs)):
            costs[i][0] += min(costs[i-1][1], costs[i-1][2])
            costs[i][1] += min(costs[i-1][0], costs[i-1][2])
            costs[i][2] += min(costs[i-1][0], costs[i-1][1])
        return min(costs[-1])
```
